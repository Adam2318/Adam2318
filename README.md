## Hey there! 👋

I'm Adam, a software engineering student based in Clermont-Ferrand, France.  

I build software, web, and mobile apps whenever I get an idea.  
Mostly working with .NET, Angular, Java, Node.js, and Flutter.  
I like clean code and building things from scratch.

**Fun facts:**  
› I'm a good football goalkeeper ⚽  
› I'm always smiling 😄
