## Hey there! 👋

I'm Adam, a software engineering student based in Clermont-Ferrand, France.

I build software, web and mobile apps whenever I get an idea.

Mostly working with .Net, Angular, Java, Node.js and Flutter.

I like clean code and building things from scratch.

Fun Facts :
  › I'm a good football goalkeeper
  › I'm always smiling, look also here : 😄
